# Mixed gas and liquid pipe contents

The playtest requires an actual composition in each gas/liquid conduit cell,
selective filtering, recipe-specific consumption, conserved heat and germs,
and exact save continuation. The current live adapter still sends mixture
constituents as separate native packets. The inventory and format controls
below are groundwork; they do not activate mixed conduit ownership.

## Conserved inventory

`ColonyConduitInventory.cs` keeps ordered constituent masses, internal energy
and every disease identity. Exact floating-point expansions retain small
components when a larger quantity is added. Internal moves subtract and add
the same shared flux; no endpoint mass, heat or passive is clipped to close
an account. A native scalar packet will be a compatibility projection rather
than the source of truth.

The focused `tools/ColonyConduitTests` control checks two materials in one
cell, different heat capacities/formation energies, selective filtering with
blocked output capacity, 1,000 repeated transfers, heat, passives, evacuation,
retention of a 1e-240 kg component and byte-exact cold continuation. Native
scalar dispatch controls retain mass below float resolution, energy that a
float temperature cannot represent, and fractional/multiple germ identities.
Live storage changes, world receipts and all conduit integrations remain to
be validated; these controls do not establish end-to-end game conservation.

Initial model measurement (Release, high CPU lock, 2026-10-23): median
0.176 us/transfer and 752 allocated bytes with one species; 0.368 us and
1,584 bytes with two species. Each uses five repeats of 20,000 alternating
moves after 50,000 warm-up moves. This measures the pure inventory only;
allocation remains an optimization target after the live correctness checks.
Run with `dotnet run --project tools/ColonyConduitTests -c Release -- --benchmark`.

## Saved framing

Format IDs **MACOLP02** and **MACPIP01** were claimed immediately after a
fresh fetch/rebase of `b36ed23` on 2026-10-23. These are managed payloads;
they do not change a native MAC checkpoint version or its bytes.

- **MACOLP01:** unchanged magic, int32 configuration length, 56-byte
  configuration, then the existing owner image. An absent pipe image keeps
  exactly these bytes and the existing packet behavior.
- **MACOLP02:** magic, int32 configuration length, 56-byte configuration,
  int32 owner-image length, owner image, int32 pipe-image length, pipe image.
  The existing `MACOLONY` save envelope hashes the entire payload.
- **MACPIP01, version 1:** magic, int32 version, six uint32 geometry fields
  (global width/height, world x/y/width/height), SHA256 catalogue identity,
  ordered pipe cells, initial/supplied/removed inventories, external heat and
  disease exchange accounts, followed by SHA256 over the complete preceding
  image. A pipe cell records its gas/liquid phase, global cell index, ordered
  masses, U and germs. Each conserved amount stores its exact ordered binary64
  atoms. Counts, lengths, phase, geometry, identities and canonical ordering
  are checked before publication; the image is limited to 256 MiB.

The runtime writer continues to emit MACOLP01. Loading MACOLP02 is refused
explicitly until end-to-end mixed ownership is ready. No old save migrates
because an environment variable or a new default changes. The codec controls
check exact legacy bytes, new-image re-encoding/continuation, incompatible
catalogue/geometry, malformed lengths, duplicate cells, corruption and the
outer envelope's coverage of the pipe payload.
